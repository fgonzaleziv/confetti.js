You can call any of the following available functions:

    confetti.start();                  //starts the confetti animation (keeps going until stopped manually)
    confetti.start(timeout);           //starts confetti animation with confetti timeout in milliseconds (if timeout is 0, it will keep going until stopped manually)
    confetti.start(timeout, amount);   //like confetti.start(timeout), but also specifies the number of confetti particles to throw (50 would be a good example)
    confetti.start(timeout, min, max); //like confetti.start(timeout), but also the specifies the number of confetti particles randomly between the specified minimum and maximum amount
    confetti.stop();        //stops adding confetti
    confetti.toggle();      //starts or stops the confetti animation depending on whether it's already running
    confetti.pause();       //freezes the confetti animation
    confetti.resume();      //unfreezes the confetti animation
    confetti.togglePause(); //toggles whether the confetti animation is paused
    confetti.remove();      //stops the confetti animation and remove all confetti immediately
    confetti.isPaused();    //returns true or false depending on whether the confetti animation is paused
    confetti.isRunning();   //returns true or false depending on whether the animation is running

You can also configure these parameters:

    confetti.maxCount = 150;     //set max confetti count
    confetti.speed = 2;          //set the particle animation speed
    confetti.frameInterval = 20; //the confetti animation frame interval in milliseconds
    confetti.alpha = 1.0;        //the alpha opacity of the confetti (between 0 and 1, where 1 is opaque and 0 is invisible)
    confetti.gradient = false;   //whether to use gradients for the confetti particles
    confetti.zIndex: 999999;     //set the z-index for the confetti
    confetti.customColors: null   //an array of rgba colors (this overrides the alpha settings)

Example:

    confetti.customColors = ["rgba(245, 40, 145, 0.8)","rgba(161, 109, 136, 0.8)","rgba(152, 223, 47, 0.8)"];
    confetti.start();
    
Enjoy!
